## About Rosalind

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving. It offers a collection of problems of varying difficulty, designed to introduce and reinforce concepts in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
rosalind-bioinformatics-solutions/
│
├── problem1/
│ ├── problem1.py
│ └── README.md
├── problem2/
│ ├── problem2.py
│ └── README.md
├── ...
│
└── README.md
Each problem has its own directory, containing the solution script and a `README.md` file that describes the problem and the approach used to solve it.
